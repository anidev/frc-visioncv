FRC Team 612 vision code that uses OpenCV, currently just for testing.

To use MJPEG with the vision programs, it is necessary to add a ".mpg"
at the end of the url if not already there. Usually a "?.mpg" or "&.mpg"
will be ignored by the MJPEG server while used by OpenCV to select
the ffmpeg MJPEG decoder.

The provided mjpg-server will start an MJPEG server on port 8080 using
netcat 2 seconds after launch. It will stream all the .jpg files found
in the current directory. The path of the url used to access the server
is ignored, any will do.
