FRC Team 612 vision code that uses OpenCV, currently just for testing.

The current branch of development is the python code. The previous c++
code can be accessed from commit 8316f0ca.

The provided mjpg-server will start an MJPEG stream 2 seconds after launch,
and will print all output to stdout. When piped to netcat, a rudimentary
MJPEG streaming server can be created. It will stream all the .jpg files found
in the current directory. The path of the url used to access the server
is ignored, any will do.

Dependencies:
numpy
opencv python bindings
robotpy
pynetworktables
